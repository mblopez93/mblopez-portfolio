cat program README file
Ma Lopez

To run, type into command line:

   ./cat [file1] [file2]...

The program should
   - basically emulate the 'cat' program on Linux
   - print out contents of files in the order they are given to the program 
   - print 'not enough arguments' if no files given 
   - print 'can't open file' if file doesn't exist
   - print 'can't read file' if read fails (not tested)
   - print 'can't write to stdout' if write fails (not tested)
