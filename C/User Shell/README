# asg1: README file for myshell.c

Compiling:
	I set up the makefile so that I could create lex.yy.c and compile
	myshell.c with just one command.

	To compile, just enter 'make' into the command line.

	This should create 'lex.yy.c' as well as an object named 'myshell'
	To clean up the files, enter 'make clean'.

Running:
	To run the file, enter './myshell' into the command file.

Functionality:
	My program can handle basic commands such as 'ls' and 'ls -l'--
	commands with and without arguments. It can also handle input and
	output file redirection, regardless of arguments.

Bugs and limitations:
	intended for the FreeBSD 10.2 Operating System
	
	It unfortunately cannot handle any piping. It appears to hang in the
	second child process, so while the left hand side of the pipe is
	executed, the right hand side appears to do nothing. I left my debug
	statements in so you could tell it's trying to do something. Work in Progress...
