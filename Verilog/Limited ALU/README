The project was to design and build an FPGA design for the operation of an 4-bit ALU capable
of performing addition (ADD), exclusive or (XOR) and no operation (NOP).

Inputs: 
	Two 4-bit inputs using switches: SW7-SW4 and SW3-SW0.
	Button inputs: left (ADD), right (XOR), none (NOP), center(Clock)
	
Outputs:
	Result of the flip-flops on the 5 LEDs LD4-LD0 (LD4 is the carry out)
	
Limitations: 
	This project was targeted for the Digilent Atlys board which uses a Spartan-6 LX45 (324-pin BGA package,
	speed grade -3) FPGA. The bit file (not included) was compiled using an Xilinx IDE.
