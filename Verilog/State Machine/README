The purpose of the project was to design and build a simple state machine that will be written in behavioral,
synthesizable Verilog by detecting the button input of Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, Center, Center. 

Input:
	Buttons - Up, Down, Left, and Center
	
Output:
	All LEDS light up when pattern is correct
	
Limitations: 
	This project was targeted for the Digilent Atlys board which uses a Spartan-6 LX45 (324-pin BGA package,
	speed grade -3) FPGA. The bit file (not included) was compiled using an Xilinx IDE.
