This program takes calculates the Euclidean and Manhattan Distances between two coordinate points, 

Input:
	2 coordinate points (2 x coordinates and 2 y coordinates)

Output:
	The Euclidean Distance and Manhattan Distance rounded to two decimal points

Bugs and limitations:
	The user has to hit Enter to move on continue inputting the other coordinates; there is an instruction explaining this at beginning.
	In some cases, the program can't get the Manhattan Distance to actually be rounded to the hundredth place; 
	because the points were casted between multiple types, the Manhattan Distance might just be an integer with one zero taking the tenth place.
